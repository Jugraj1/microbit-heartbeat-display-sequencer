## Code
Implemented a light show with scanning and combined brightness/speed control using buttons.

Style:

Poor function/handler layout

Poor functionalisation (a lot of repeated code, hardcoding of image locations)

## Report

Nice report overall.

Some parts of your report are unclear. For example, it's not clear what this
section means, or how it relates to your implementation:

> A specialized If-then-else block was implemented to streamline comparisons 
> effectively. To simplify condition checking, bits were stored in memory, 
> especially within loops where tracking them became challenging.
